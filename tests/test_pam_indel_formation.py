"""
Test suite for INDEL-related PAM formation detection.

This test suite specifically validates that get_pam_disrupting_alt_sequences
correctly identifies when INDELs create NEW PAM sites rather than disrupting them.

Key scenarios tested:
1. Deletion bringing nucleotides together to form a new PAM (NOT disrupting)
2. Insertion creating a new PAM sequence (NOT disrupting)
3. Deletion that genuinely disrupts an existing PAM
4. Insertion that disrupts an existing PAM by shifting it
5. Mixed scenarios with multiple PAMs
